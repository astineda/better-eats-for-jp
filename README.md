### How to develop

You can directly edit the extension via tampermonkey dashboard or load
`script.user.js` file

To load the the script file, create a new script with only the following header

```
// ==UserScript==
// @name         Better Eats
// @namespace    https://ubereats.com/
// @grant        none
// @require      file://<path to script.user.js>
// ==/UserScript==
```

From there, enable local file url access via https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php?locale=en#Q204
